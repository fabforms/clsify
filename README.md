## Installation

Install `clsify` via npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install clsify
# or
yarn add clsify
````

## Usage

### Basic Usage

The core functionality of `clsify` is to conditionally join class names. You can pass strings, arrays, and objects, 
and it will intelligently build the correct class names for you.

```js
import clsify from 'clsify';

const buttonClass = clsify('btn', 'btn-primary', { 'btn-large': isLarge });

console.log(buttonClass); // 'btn btn-primary btn-large' (if isLarge is true)
```

### Conditional Class Names

You can use `clsify` with conditional values, which is perfect for conditionally applying classes based on state or props.

```js
const isActive = true;
const buttonClass = clsify('btn', isActive && 'btn-active', 'btn-large');

console.log(buttonClass); // 'btn btn-active btn-large' (if isActive is true)
```

### Handling Arrays

`clsify` supports arrays, allowing you to pass multiple values at once and let it handle the logic for you.

```js
const buttonClass = clsify(['btn', 'btn-primary', 'btn-large']);
console.log(buttonClass); // 'btn btn-primary btn-large'
```

### Handling Objects

You can also pass objects where the keys represent the class names and the values are booleans, indicating whether the class should be included.

```js
const buttonClass = clsify({
  'btn': true,
  'btn-primary': true,
  'btn-large': false // This will be omitted
});

console.log(buttonClass); // 'btn btn-primary'
```

### With Modifiers

`clsify` includes a helper for adding modifiers to your class names. This is useful for utility-based CSS frameworks where you may need to dynamically add modifiers.

```js
const modifiedClass = clsify.withModifier('btn', ['active', 'large']);

console.log(modifiedClass); // 'btn btn--active btn--large'
```

### With Prefixes

You can add a prefix to your class names, which is useful when working with BEM-style naming or any custom naming conventions.

```js
const prefixedClass = clsify.withPrefix('my-prefix', 'btn', 'active');

console.log(prefixedClass); // 'my-prefix-btn my-prefix-active'
```

### Responsive Classes

If you're working with responsive designs, `clsify` allows you to easily manage classes for different screen sizes.

```js
const responsiveClass = clsify.responsive('lg', 'btn', 'active', 'large');

console.log(responsiveClass); // 'btn active large lg-btn lg-active lg-large'
```

### Chainable API

You can also chain multiple operations for progressive class-building.

```js
const classBuilder = clsify.chain('btn');
const finalClass = classBuilder
  .add('primary')
  .modifier(['active'])
  .prefix('my-prefix')
  .responsive('sm')
  .add('rounded')
  .toString();

console.log(finalClass); // 'btn primary my-prefix-btn my-prefix-active sm-btn sm-active sm-rounded'
```

### Helper Functions

* **`clsify.withModifier(baseClass, modifiers)`**: Add modifiers to a base class.
* **`clsify.withPrefix(prefix, ...classes)`**: Add a prefix to multiple class names.
* **`clsify.responsive(prefix, ...classes)`**: Generate responsive class names.
* **`clsify.chain(initialClass)`**: Chain multiple class name operations for a clean and progressive API.

## Benefits

* **Cleaner Code**: Reduce the complexity of dynamically generating class names.
* **Better Readability**: Use plain, readable JavaScript syntax to manage class names.
* **Performance**: Efficiently handle class names without unnecessary computations.
* **Flexibility**: Whether you're using arrays, objects, or chaining, `clsify` can handle it all.

## Example Project

Hereâ€™s an example of how `clsify` can be used in a real-world project:

```js
import clsify from 'clsify';

const isActive = true;
const isPrimary = false;
const isLarge = true;

const buttonClass = clsify(
  'btn',
  isPrimary && 'btn-primary',
  isActive && 'btn-active',
  isLarge && 'btn-large'
);

console.log(buttonClass); // 'btn btn-active btn-large'
```
